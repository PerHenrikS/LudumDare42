- **Theme** - Running out of space.
- **Implementation** - Godot 3
- **Mode** - Compo (All content in 48h ie. assets, music, code) 

## Rumble! - Play [here](www.google.com) (Loading takes a while)

#### Description: 
You are trapped in a collapsing cave. There is no way out, but you can live in peace... as long as you keep 
throwing falling rocks on the walls. 

- Gather rocks to replenish ammo 
- The more you gather the faster they will spawn 
- Walls will start closing in faster the longer you are alive


### Implementation: 

- **Engine** - I chose to use [Godot3](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-0-released) because I've only heard good about it, also I am a bit bored of Unity. 
Apparently Godot is really nice, atleast for small 2D games. The code is not organised, not going to start optimising a 
LudumDare game. 

- **Music** - Music slapped together in [BoscaCeoil](https://boscaceoil.net/)

- **Effects** - Audacity
